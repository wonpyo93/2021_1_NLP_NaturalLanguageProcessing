TOPIC: Diffusion Improves Graph Learning
URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05485.pdf
간략 설명: Instead of aggregating information only from the first-hop neighbors, GDC aggregates information from a larger neighborhood. —> Neighborhood is constructed via a new graph generated by sparsifying a generalized form of a graph diffusion
Generalized Graph Diffusion (page 2 참고) —> S:
  weighting coefficients * generalized transition matrix T.
  T in an undirected graph include the random walk transition matrix T_rw = A * D^-1
  T of symmetric transition matrx T_sym = D^-1/2 * A * D^-1/2
