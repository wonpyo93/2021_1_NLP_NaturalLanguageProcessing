TOPIC: Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Networks for Semi-supervised Node Classification
URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06667.pdf
간략 설명: Hierarchical Graph Convolution Network (H-GCN)
(성능표에서 GAT가 72.5, GCN이 70.3인데 이건 72.8 라서 대충 읽었음)
First work to design a deep hierarchical model for semi-supervised node classification task
