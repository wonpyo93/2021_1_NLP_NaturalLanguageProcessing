간략 설명: JK networks = Jumping Knowledge Networks (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE 와 결합 가능)
Introduction에서 2 layer보다 더 많이 보는걸 residual로 가능하게 했지만 'citation networks'의 경우 그렇지 않다고 말했음...!!!!!!!!!!!!
we propose an architecture that, as opposed to existing models, enables adaptive, structure-aware representations. Such representations are particularly interesting for representation learning on large complex graphs with diverse subgraph structures.
dataset의 특성에 따라 어떻게 결합해야하는지가 다르다고 생각해서 그거에 초점을 맞췄음
3. Influence Distribution and Random Walks
    measure the sensitivity of node x to node y, or the influence of y on x, by measuring how much a change in the input feature of y affects the representation of x in the last layer. For any node x, the influence distribution captures the relative influences of all other nodes.
    Influence score I(x,y) —> Definition 3.1
Large radii may lead to too much averaging, while small radii may lead to insufficient information aggregation. Thus, we propose two simple yet powerful architectural changes —> jump connection and a subsequent selective but adaptive aggregation mechanism
Layer Aggregation!!!
근데 엄청난 사실. Table 2를 보면 GAT가 Citeseer에서 76.2가 나온다고함 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
