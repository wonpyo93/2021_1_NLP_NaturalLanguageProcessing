간략 설명: GCN2 —> 사실 GCN II —> GCN + Initial residual + Identity mapping
여기서 사실 GCN + Initial residual = APPNP이라서 APPNP + Identity mapping임
그럼 Identity Mapping이 무엇이냐 (derived from ResNet)
    at the l-th layer, add identity matrix In to the weight matrix W(l)
    —> ensures that a 'deep' model achieves at least the same performance as its shallow version does
    —> by setting 베타 sufficiently small, deep GCNII ignores the weight matrix W(l) and essentially simulates APPNP
